        When it comes to coding, it can be hard to jump into it and begin
        learning because new things develop everyday. As, computer scientists,
        we must be ready to learn and adapt to the dynamic world around us. I
        know I am not alone when it comes to wondering on the best resources to
        stay on top of my field. I have provided different youtube playlists,
        udemy courses, and websites that have helped push me to further learn
        about coding. Here are some of my most helpful ones!

        <p>
          As a student at Oakland University, we emphsized a lot on Java
          learning. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I found it more difficult to
          interact with my Professors and to learn everything to its full
          potential. I decided to take initiative and discover a new way to
          learn code without school. Udemy courses allowed to get the basic
          foundations for multiple languages and I still continue to use use
          each course when wanting to learn new things.

          Sometimes, as a college student, finding money can be a difficult
          task. Luckily, multiple computer science based youtube channels are
          there to assist just about anyone. They are a great resource for
          advice, motivation, and coding practice.
